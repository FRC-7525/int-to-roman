# Roman Numeral to Integer

In this challenge, you have to convert Roman Numerals to 
their decimal (integer) representation. The only rule: this is a common programming challenge, so please, no searching online for answers!

I'm looking for concise solutions, so instead of writing the first thing that comes to mind, think about the problem first and try to figure out shortcuts that a computer can take to make the problem easier. After you write your solution, give your code a read-through for style and efficiency.

**Once you're done, please fill this out!**
